# raft

This is an implementation of the [Raft distributed consensus protocol][paper].
It's heavily influenced by [benbjohnson's implementation][goraft].
It focuses on providing a clean and usable API, and well-structured internals.

## Usage

A node in a Raft network is represented by a [Server][server] structure. In a
typical application, nodes will create a Server, and expose it to other nodes
using a [Peer][peer] interface.

[server]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#Server
[peer]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#Peer

The core raft package includes a [Local Peer][localpeer] wrapper, which provides
a Peer interface to a Server within the same process-space. This is really only
useful for testing and demonstration purposes.

[localpeer]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#LocalPeer

For real-life applications, you'll probably want to expose your Server via some
kind of network transport. This library includes a [HTTP Transport][httpt]
(ingress) and [HTTP Peer][httpp] (egress) which combine to allow communication
via REST-ish endpoints. For now, it's the simplest way to embed a Raft server in
your application. See [this complete example][example-http].

[httpt]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#HTTPTransport
[httpp]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#HTTPPeer
[example-http]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#_example_HTTPNode

Several other transports are coming; see TODO, below.


## Adding and removing nodes

The Raft protocol has no affordance for node discovery or "join/leave"
semantics. Rather, the protocol assumes an ideal network configuration that's
known _a priori_ to all nodes in the network, and describes a mechanism (called
_joint-consensus_) to safely replicate that configuration.

My implementation of joint-consensus abides those fundamental assumptions. Nodes
may be added or removed dynamically by requesting a **SetConfiguration** that
describes a complete network topology.


## TODO

* ~~Leader election~~ _done_
* ~~Log replication~~ _done_
* ~~Basic unit tests~~ _done_
* ~~HTTP transport~~ _done_
* [net/rpc][netrpc] transport
* Other transports?
* ~~Configuration changes (joint-consensus mode)~~ _done_
* Log compaction
* Robust demo application â˜œ **up next**
* Complex unit tests (one per scenario described in the paper)
